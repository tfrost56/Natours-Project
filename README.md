# Natours Project

This is a outdoor touring website built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Advanced CSS and Sass. This was my first experience using Sass and making a webpage fully responsive. This project improved my CSS knowledge greatly through a variety of animations, layouts, responsive imagery.
